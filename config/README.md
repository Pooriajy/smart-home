# Configuration Folder

The **config** or **settings** folder is designed to store configuration files and settings used by the project. This folder serves as a centralized location to manage various configurations that control the behavior and parameters of the project.

## Purpose

The configuration folder serves the following purposes:

- **Application Configuration**: It stores configuration files that define the settings and behavior of the application, such as database connections, API keys, environment variables, or other runtime configurations.
- **Customization Options**: It allows users or administrators to customize certain aspects of the project by modifying the configuration files.
- **Version Control**: Keeping configuration files in a dedicated folder facilitates version control, making it easier to track changes and revert to previous configurations if needed.

## Structure

The configuration files within the folder can be organized based on their purpose or module. It is common to have separate files for different components or subsystems of the project. You can create subdirectories or follow any existing project conventions to maintain a structured organization.

## Usage

To utilize the configuration files in your project, access them programmatically from the appropriate locations within your code. Most programming languages provide libraries or frameworks to load and parse configuration files, allowing you to access the settings and apply them to the project.

It is recommended to provide clear instructions within the project's documentation or README.md file on how to modify the configuration files and specify any required or sensitive information that needs to be provided.

## Contributing to Configuration

Contributions to the configuration files are typically managed through version control systems and pull requests. If the project allows for contributions or customizations to the configuration, include guidelines or instructions for contributors in this README.md file or create a separate CONTRIBUTING.md file.
