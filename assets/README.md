# Assets Folder

The **docs** or **assets** folder is used to store various media files and assets that are utilized in the project. This folder serves as a central location for images, icons, audio files, video files, and other media resources used in the project.

## Purpose

The assets folder serves the following purposes:

- **Visual Resources**: It stores images, icons, or graphics used for the project's user interface, design elements, or visual representations.
- **Media Files**: It contains audio or video files that are incorporated into the project, such as sound effects, background music, or multimedia content.
- **Additional Resources**: It can include other types of files that support the project, such as PDF documents, presentations, or downloadable files.

## Structure

Organize the assets folder based on file types or categories to ensure a logical organization of the resources. You can create subdirectories within the folder to further categorize or differentiate the assets based on their purpose or usage.

## Usage

To utilize the assets in your project, refer to the appropriate file paths within your code, HTML, or CSS files. You can also access and use the assets in your documentation, presentations, or any other project-related materials.

It is recommended to use relative paths when referencing the assets to ensure portability and compatibility across different environments or platforms.

## Contributing to Assets

Contributions to the assets folder are usually welcome. If users or contributors have additional media files or resources that they believe would benefit the project, provide guidelines or instructions on how to contribute to the assets folder in the project's documentation or README.md file.
