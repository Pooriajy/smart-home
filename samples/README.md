# Examples Folder

The **examples** or **samples** folder contains practical examples, sample code, or small projects that are relevant to your main project. This folder serves as a helpful resource for users or contributors to understand the usage and implementation of different features or functionalities.

## Purpose

The examples folder serves the following purposes:

- **Demonstration**: It provides working examples to showcase specific use cases, techniques, or implementations related to your project.
- **Learning Resource**: Users can refer to the examples to learn and understand how to utilize different components or modules of the project effectively.
- **Reference Code**: The examples folder serves as a reference library, offering reusable code snippets that can be adapted and integrated into other parts of the project.

## Structure

Organize the examples or samples into subdirectories based on different topics, functionalities, or specific use cases. This helps users easily locate relevant examples and ensures a clear organization of the provided resources.

## Usage

To utilize the examples, users can navigate to the specific example folder, review the code, and follow any accompanying instructions or documentation provided within the example. Users can use these examples as a starting point or reference to implement similar functionality in their own projects.

It is recommended to provide clear explanations, comments, or documentation within the example code to guide users and help them understand the purpose and functionality of each example.

## Contributing Examples

Contributions to the examples folder are encouraged and can enhance the value of the project for users and contributors. If users or contributors have additional examples or sample code to contribute, provide guidelines or instructions on how to contribute to the examples folder in the project's documentation or README.md file.
