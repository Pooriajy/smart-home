## Executive Summary
The executive summary provides an overview of the project assessment document, which evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing two scenarios in a home automation system. The first scenario involves controlling a lamp through a Telegram bot, while the second scenario focuses on scheduling device control. The assessment identifies functional requirements such as user control via the Telegram bot, communication between the bot, server, and devices, and reliable execution of commands. Non-functional requirements include reliability, security, scalability, performance, usability, compatibility, and maintainability. The assessment outcomes will guide decision-making and ensure the successful development and deployment of the home automation system.

## Introduction
The introduction of the project assessment document provides an overview of the project's purpose and scope. It outlines two key scenarios: Telegram Bot Control and Scheduled Device Control. The assessment aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing these scenarios. The functional requirements include lamp control through the Telegram bot, communication between the bot, server, and devices, and scheduling device activation or deactivation. Non-functional requirements encompass reliability, security, scalability, performance, usability, compatibility, and maintainability. The introduction sets the context for the assessment and establishes the goals for evaluating the project's success in implementing the identified scenarios.

## Methodology
The methodology section of the project assessment document outlines the systematic approach to be followed during the assessment process. The methodology includes steps such as requirement analysis, data collection, establishing evaluation criteria, selecting assessment tools and techniques, data analysis, risk assessment, providing recommendations, and documenting the process. The assessment will analyze the project against established criteria, identify strengths and weaknesses, assess risks, and propose actionable recommendations. By following this methodology, the assessment aims to provide valuable insights for decision-making and ensure the successful implementation of the project.

## Current Project Status
The current project status section provides an overview of the progress made in implementing the project scenarios and meeting the functional and non-functional requirements. Scenario 1, which involves Telegram Bot Control, has been successfully implemented with a functional Telegram bot, seamless user requests forwarding, and effective communication with the Arduino board. Scenario 2, focused on Scheduled Device Control, has been achieved, allowing users to set schedules and devices to operate automatically. The system meets the functional requirements by enabling lamp control and scheduling, while also addressing non-functional requirements such as reliability, security, scalability, performance, usability, compatibility, and maintainability.
