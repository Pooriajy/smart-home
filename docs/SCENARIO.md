This document outlines the scenarios for the project, describing the functional requirements for each scenario.

## Scenario 1: Telegram Bot Control

- Users should be able to request control over their lamp through the Telegram bot.
- The Telegram bot receives the user's request and forwards it to the server.
- The server sends the request to the Arduino board, which in turn instructs the device to turn the lamp on or off.

## Scenario 2: Scheduled Device Control

- Users can set specific time schedules for turning the devices on or off.
- The configured schedule is sent to the respective devices.
- The devices will automatically turn on or off at the specified time.

Please note that this document provides a high-level overview of the project scenarios and their corresponding functional requirements. For more detailed information, please refer to the relevant documentation and code implementation.
