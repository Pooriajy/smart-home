# Tests Folder

The **tests** or **unit-tests** folder contains the test files and scripts used for testing the functionality and behavior of the project. This folder is dedicated to ensuring the quality and reliability of the codebase by running automated tests.

## Purpose

The tests folder serves the following purposes:

- **Unit Testing**: It contains unit tests that validate the individual components or units of code, ensuring they function correctly in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: It includes integration tests that verify the interaction and compatibility between different modules or components of the project.
- **Functional Testing**: It houses functional tests that simulate real-world scenarios and validate the overall functionality of the project.
- **Regression Testing**: It stores regression tests that ensure that previously resolved issues or bugs do not reappear in subsequent versions.

## Frameworks and Tools

The tests can be written using various testing frameworks and tools depending on the project's requirements and programming language. Some commonly used frameworks include JUnit, PyTest, Mocha, or Selenium, among others. Please refer to the project's specific documentation for the recommended testing frameworks and guidelines.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, follow the instructions provided in the project's documentation or the README.md file located in this tests folder. It typically involves executing the test scripts or using specific commands to trigger the automated test suite.

## Writing Tests

When writing tests, it is essential to focus on test coverage, including both positive and negative scenarios, edge cases, and boundary conditions. Clear and descriptive test names and assertions help in understanding the purpose and expected outcomes of each test case.

## Continuous Integration

Consider integrating the tests folder with a continuous integration (CI) system such as Travis CI, Jenkins, or CircleCI. This enables automated testing on every code commit or pull request, ensuring that new changes do not introduce unexpected issues or regressions.

## Contributing to Tests

Contributions to the tests folder are highly encouraged. If you identify bugs, issues, or areas for improvement, please follow the project's contribution guidelines to report them or submit pull requests with relevant test cases.
